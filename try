.SYNOPSIS
    This script automates the process of enabling the classic Windows 10 right-click context menu by modifying registry keys.
    
.DESCRIPTION
     The "Classic Context Menu" PowerShell script facilitates the modification of registry keys to activate the classic Windows 10 
     right-click context menu. This menu style is favored by users seeking a more traditional interface experience. The script checks
     for the existence of the required registry path, creates it if absent, and stops File Explorer to apply changes effectively.
